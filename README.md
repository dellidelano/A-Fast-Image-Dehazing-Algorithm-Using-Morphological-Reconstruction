# A-Fast-Image-Dehazing-Algorithm-Using-Morphological-Reconstruction
This project was based on the IEEE report "A Fast Image Dehazing Algorithm Using Morphological Reconstruction" produced by S. Salazar-Colores, E. et al.

As part of my graduate project, I used the Matlab software to replicate the findings of the report.
To execute my codes, you can run the file Image_Dehazing.m in the Matlab GUI.
Before executing the script, ensure the sub-directories input_images and output_images are present.
The input hazed image should be located in a sub-directory called input_images.

Enjoy!
